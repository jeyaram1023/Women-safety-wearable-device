This project is a **complete IoT solution for women‚Äôs personal safety**. It combines a wearable **ESP32 Watch module** and a connected **ESP8266-based Smart Shoe**, linked with the ESP-NOW wireless protocol for fast emergency communication. The system enables instant distress alerts, vital health data transmission, and automated location sharing to trusted contacts.

## üí° Problem Statement

Despite modern advances, women's safety remains a critical issue. This device provides immediate, hands-free emergency notifications with GPS tracking and health monitoring to enhance personal security.

## üöÄ Solution Overview

- Wearable watch module monitors movement, pulse, gas levels, and manual emergency button.
- Smart shoe module receives emergency alerts, activates GPS & GSM, and sends SMS with location.
- Each module displays battery status and health info on an LCD.
- Local web applications hosted on both devices allow real-time monitoring and control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jeyaram1023/Women-safety-wearable-device.git


2. Install Arduino IDE 2.3.6 with ESP32 and ESP8266 board support.

3. Install required libraries:

- LiquidCrystal_I2C
- RTClib
- TinyGPS++
- ArduinoJson

4. Upload `Women-Safety-Device-ESP8266-002.ino` first:

- Copy the MAC address from Serial Monitor.
- Update the MAC in the Watch module code.

5. Upload `Women-Safety-Device-ESP32-002.ino` with updated MAC address.

6. Update emergency contact numbers in the Shoe module code, replacing placeholders with real international format numbers.

7. Access the web applications by connecting to these WiFi networks:

- Watch module: `WomenSafetyWatch` (password: `safety123`) ‚Üí [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)
- Shoe module: `WomenSafetyShoe` (password: `safety123`) ‚Üí [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)

## üß™ Testing & Usage

- Test button press, shaking emergency activation.
- Verify GPS fix and GSM SMS functionality outdoors.
- Use the web app for monitoring battery, heart rate, gas level and GPS location.
- Triple press button for emergency deactivation.
