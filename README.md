## üîé Project Overview

The **Women Safety Device** is an advanced dual-module IoT system designed to enhance personal safety for women. It consists of:  

1. **Smart Watch Module** ‚Äì monitors user movement, health parameters, and triggers emergency alerts.  
2. **Smart Slippers Module** ‚Äì receives alerts, activates deterrent systems, and sends GPS/GSM location to emergency contacts.  

The system uses **ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers** and communicates via **ESP-NOW protocol** for fast, low-power, and reliable signal transfer between modules.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The static electric deterrent is **simulated for demonstration purposes**, and no harmful currents are used.

## üß© Technical Logic & How It Works

### 1. Emergency Activation Logic
Emergency mode can be activated by either:

- **Manual Activation:** Long press the watch button for 3 seconds  
- **Automatic Activation:** Abnormal shaking or sudden movement detected for >5 seconds via the **ADXL335 accelerometer**  

Once activated:  
- Watch LCD shows *‚ÄúWomen Safety Device Activated‚Äù*  
- Buzzer sounds for 3 seconds  
- Gas sensor readings and heart rate are recorded  
- Watch sends an emergency packet via **ESP-NOW** to the slippers  

---

### 2. Smart Slippers Module Logic
Upon receiving the emergency packet:  

- **Deterrent Activation:** Non-injurious deterrent simulation (alarm, strobe, vibration) representing a **static electric deterrent** to repel attackers and allow safe escape  
- **GPS Activation:** Acquires current location  
- **GSM Alerts:** Sends SMS with location and emergency details to pre-configured contacts  
- **Battery & Sensor Update:** Reports status back to the web dashboard  

If the watch detects **no movement post-activation**, an additional alert is sent:  
> *‚ÄúUser has fainted and fallen down.‚Äù*

---

### 3. Deactivation Logic
- Triple-press the watch button ‚Üí disables emergency mode  
- Sends a **cancel packet** to slippers ‚Üí turns off GPS, GSM, and deterrents  
- Web dashboard updates to reflect system deactivation  

---

### 4. Web App Integration
The local web app (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) provides:  

- Real-time **battery percentages** of watch and slippers  
- Current **GPS location** of the user  
- Heart rate and gas sensor data from the watch  
- History of all emergency notifications  
- Ability to **add/edit emergency contacts** and manage alerts
